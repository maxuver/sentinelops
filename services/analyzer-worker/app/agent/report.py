"""Incident review report, generated from the incident history (ADR-0005).

Modelled on the review document an engineering manager actually reads: which
causes dominate, when incidents happen (night, weekend), where they happen,
how often the assistant was right, and what to do about it. Assembling that
by hand for one production API took days; every input to it is already in
the `incidents` table.

The numbers are computed in SQL and rendered by code, so they are always
right. The model contributes only the closing section (observations and
P0/P1/P2 recommendations) and is handed the aggregates as data with an
instruction to use no other figures. If the model is unavailable, the report
ships without that section (ADR-0003).
