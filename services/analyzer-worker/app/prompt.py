"""Prompt construction for the single structured analysis call (ADR-0001).

Pure functions only. The context bundle is inserted as clearly-fenced, untrusted
data: the system prompt instructs the model to treat anything inside it as data,
never as instructions. Combined with the fact that the model holds no tools and
its output is never executed, this contains prompt injection through log content
to, at worst, a wrong suggestion in chat.
